    James was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[28] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[29] At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game.[30] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[31] The Cavaliers finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.

    In January of the 2014–15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[167] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[38] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls.[168] In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[169] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[169] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[170] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[171] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.

    During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt.[172][173] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[174] James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[38] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[174] who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season.[175] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[176] James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[177] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes,[178][179][180] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[181] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[182] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[176] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.
